We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue

Security vulnerabilities should be reported privately to prevent exploitation.

### 2. Email us directly

Send an email to: **security@LMWebUI.dev**

Include the following information:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)
- Your contact information

## 🚫 Known Security Considerations

### Ollama Integration
- **Local Only**: Ollama runs locally on your machine
- **No Authentication**: Ollama doesn't require authentication by default
- **Network Access**: Ollama listens on localhost:11434
